            I'm Alison, the creator behind the Wholesome Home Cook.
            A community focused on wholesome food and learning basic cooking techniques.

            <p>
            My mission is to help make cooking more fun, make you feel more confident in the kitchen, and connect like minded people together through this community.

            <p>
            I have been cooking for over 16 years starting out in a 4 year culinary program and continued cooking almost everyday from there. Now, I get to help others learn how to cook wholesome food at home!
